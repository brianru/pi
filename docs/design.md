Noun Verb Value

Verb == async channels

Noun == first part of message -- what's being delivered

What's the value? Well yes, it's the piece of data.. the noun is the
type. So x type of data can be delivered via y verb. But what happens
next? We're missing the meaning, the intent. 

Verb + Noun should suffice for a listener to identity itself on a
broadcast channel

How can an ontology define WHAT must be done with such messages?
