# Project Pi

This is a hyper local, ephemeral information platform.

It's like a local reddit.

You cannot choose what information you see, it is based on your location. It is not primarily topic-driven.

The 'information radius' is a function of the usage and population density of your location.

Users will be able to teleport to different locations to read, but not contribute to the conversation.

Users will also be able to travel through time. Why not?
