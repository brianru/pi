### UX
User Goals
- learn about people at places

Business Goals
- drive clicks to ads

### Psychology
##### What is the user’s motivation to be here in the first place?
looks interesting

##### How does this make them feel?
Intrigued, but skeptical

##### How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?
A few clicks, no information to enter.
TODO incorporate limited versions of core features into the runway

##### What habits are created if they do this over and over?
Check out the local page, then check out a few favorite locations elsewhere.

##### What do they expect when they click this?
The most interesting messages.

##### Are you assuming they know something that they haven’t learned yet?
Possible, that the radius changes.

##### Is this something they want to do again? Why? How often?
Yes, because it changes and they want to keep up with what's being talked about.
Every few days or when something particularly interesting is happening.

##### Are you thinking of the user’s wants and needs, or your own?
The users'!

##### How are you rewarding good behaviour?
Better information, better conversation -> network effects.
How else?


### Usability
Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
Are there any user mistakes you could prevent? (Hint: Yes, there are.)
Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)?
Are you working with the user’s assumptions, or against them?
Have you provided everything the user needs to know?
Could you solve this just as well by doing something more common?
Are you basing your decisions on your own logic or categories, or the user’s intuition? How do you know?
If the user doesn’t read the fine print, does it still work/make sense?

### Design
Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?
Does the design lead the user’s eyes to the right places? How do you know?
Do the colours, shapes, and typography help people find what they want and improve usability of the details?
Do clickable things look different than non-clickable things?

### Copywriting
Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?
Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want?
Is the biggest text the most important text? Why not?
Does it inform the user or does it assume that they already know what its about?
Does it reduce anxiety?
Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?

### Analysis
Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?
Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?
Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?
Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?
Are you looking at absolute numbers, or relative improvements?
How will you measure this? Are you measuring the right things?
Are you looking for bad results too? Why not?
How can you use this analysis to make improvements?
